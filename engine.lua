    Only the first section that has any actions gets its actions run.

    and some other thing...

    It also ruins killing undying units with Sickness, but undying
    is not an ability in Codex.

    MtG has some sections we don't have but could:
      - The legend rule in Codex does not allow two of the same Legend to
        ever be under a player's control, so we don't need it here.
        TODO: Make sure that's true with e.g. feral strike for 2x degrey
      - Update: We DO need a legend rule here, because the expiration of a
        copy effect could also cause a player to have 2 of the same legend.
        So that sucks.
      - The rule about auras not attached to things dying will probably be
        handled by an action on the expiration of the effect that binds
        an aura to a thing.
