    Only the first section that has any actions gets its actions run.

    This makes deaths that should be simultaneous simultaneous when you
    cast Sickness targeting Doubling Barbarbarian with a +1/+1 rune
    and some other thing...

    It also ruins killing undying units with Sickness, but undying
    is not an ability in Codex.

    MtG has some sections we don't have but could:
      - The legend rule in Codex does not allow two of the same Legend to
        ever be under a player's control, so we don't need it here.
        TODO: Make sure that's true with e.g. feral strike for 2x degrey
      - Update: We DO need a legend rule here, because the expiration of a
        copy effect could also cause a player to have 2 of the same legend.
        So that sucks.
      - The rule about auras not attached to things dying will probably be
        handled by an action on the expiration of the effect that binds
        an aura to a thing.

  -- TODO
  -- If a permanent is in play, ensure that it has an "arrived" timestamp,
  -- a "came under control" timestamp, a "established identity" timestamp,
  -- and for heroes mid level or higher, also timestamps for their mid and
  -- max level abilities.
  -- If the controller changed, the identity changed, or the hero leveled
  -- down, update those timestamps appropriately.

  -- TODO
  -- If a player has two or more of the same Legendary permanent,
  -- all but one are trashed. The one that survives is the one that
  -- has had that identity for the longest time.
  -- So every permanent has to keep track of its last known identity
  -- and how long it has had that.
  -- (actually, only UNITS can copy things, so maybe all this stuff
  -- is just for Legendary Units)


  -- TODO
  -- If a token is in any zone other than in play, it is trashed.


  -- TODO
  -- If a player has no base, the game is over.
  -- Note that some other abilities can cause the game to end,
  -- So this isn't the only place where game over happens.


  -- TODO
  -- If an effect says it should expire, it expires.
  -- Some effects do stuff when they expire (other than just stop applying).
  -- Effects that granted armor take armor away on expiration.
  -- Aura effects (like Soul Stone) kill the attached spell card on expiration.


  -- TODO
  -- If a unit or hero has both +1/+1 and -1/-1 runes, they cancel


  -- TODO
  --[[
    If a unit or hero or building has damage marked on it greater than or
      equal to its HP, it dies.
    If a unit or hero has just taken damage from a thing that has deathtouch,
      it dies.
    The following two things apply to deaths in general, but we have to
      do them here to make sure we don't make no-op state based actions.
      (that would cause an infinite loop)
    If it has the Glaxx ability and its controller has gold and
      it has not just taken combat damage, it doesn't die.
    If it is indestructible and has 0 or less HP and is already tapped,
      and has no damage, nothing happens.

    Here are some other things that replace dying in general, but which
      we DON'T need code for here. The code for this stuff should go
      somewhere else where it can handle all deathy things, including
      doom grasp:
        If it has Soul Stone, instead do the Soul Stone thing.
        If it has the Brave Knight ability and it has just taken combat damage,
          it goes to the owner's hand.
        If it is indestructible you do the indestructible thing instead.
